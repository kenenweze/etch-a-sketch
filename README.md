This is a project that is part of The Odin Project Foundstions course.

The assignment is to create a 16x16 grid of square divs using Javascript.

And then create a button that draws a new grid of a number of squares per side entered by the user.
The new grid should occupy the same space consistently.
The grid squares should also change colour when the mouse hovers over them.
